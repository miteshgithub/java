1) If you define multiple classes in a single java source file, it is a good idea to save the file name with the class name which has main() method.

2) There is no copy constructor in java. However, we can copy the values from one object to another like copy constructor in C++

3) Constructor returns current class instance. 

4) There are two main restrictions for the static method. They are:

The static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
this and super cannot be used in static context.
